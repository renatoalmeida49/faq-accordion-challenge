## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
  
Still strungling with background posicion. The overflow effect in the desktop version was a great challenge and I really enjoy how to work with the background and the image. It was tricky to understand how it was made.

### Continued development

I really would like to correct how I used the background-position.  
  
Add the use of SASS/SCSS to a better CSS file.

### Useful resources

- [Background Gradient](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp) - To make the background of the website. I didn't remember how to use it. Here I found really helpful resources.
- [The dl tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_dl.asp) - This is something we really should be aware: the HTML needs a good semantic. Of course everything can be done using <div> and <span>, but it's important to know the tags and use them correctly to better acessibility and search tools.
- [Styling the hr tag](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_style_hr.asp) - A really simple tag, but got me stuck to styling. Once again a really good link to show me how to style properly.
